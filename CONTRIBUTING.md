# Contributing

## Getting Started
1. Review open issues with the _help wanted_ tag. Once you find an feature you'd like to work on, assign it to yourself.
2. Fork and then clone the repo:
``` git clone git@github.com:your-username/data-munging```
3. Make your changes! :tada:
4. Push to your fork and ![submit a pull request](https://github.com/SalvatoreTosti/data-munging/compare "submit a pull request")
5. Put up your feet while I review your changes.  :v:  
I'll let you know if any adjustments are necessary before your changes are accepted.
